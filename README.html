    Index Page
    Your app should have an index page where
    
    all the products are displayed
    the images link to the product's show page
    and there should be a link to add a new product.
    Show Page
    Your show page should display a product with
    
    a link back to the products
    a link to edit the product (goes to the edit page)
    a delete button that deletes
    and the number of items remaining in stock
    Example
    If the quantity of your item is zero, the show page should say 'OUT OF STOCK' instead of saying how many are remaining. (Hint: conditionals in jsx).
    On the edit page, make sure you can set the quantity to zero if you want so that you can test if this is working.
    The BUY button should also not be rendered if the quantity of the item is zero
    New & Edit Page
    These views should render forms and submit to the appropriate routes.
     
    
    Redirects
    The create route should redirect to the index
    The delete route should redirect to the index
    The updated route will redirect back to the product's show page.
    For the Hungry for more? the BUY button will go to a route that redirects back to the product's show page
    Technical Requirements
    Your app MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong
    Must contain all 7 Restful Routes
    Must be styled and look like a store
