<h4>Index Page</h4>
<p>Your app should have an index page where</p>
<ul>
    <li>all the products are displayed</li>
    <li>the images link to the product's show page</li>
    <li>and there should be a link to add a new product.</li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Show Page</h4>
<p>Your show page should display a product with</p>
<ul>
    <li>a link back to the products</li>
    <li>a link to edit the product (goes to the edit page)</li>
    <li>a delete button that deletes and the number of items remaining in stock</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example</h5>
<p>If the quantity of your item is zero, the show page should say 'OUT OF STOCK' instead of saying how many are remaining. <i>(Hint: conditionals in jsx).</i></p>
<p>On the edit page, make sure you can set the quantity to zero if you want so that you can test if this is working.</p>
<p>The BUY button should also not be rendered if the quantity of the item is zero</p>

<p>These views should render forms and submit to the appropriate routes.</p>
